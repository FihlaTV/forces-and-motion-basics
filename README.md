Forces and Motion: Basics  
=============
Forces and Motion: Basics  
an educational simulation in HTML5  
by [PhET Interactive Simulations](http://phet.colorado.edu/) at the University of Colorado Boulder  

Explore the forces at work in a tug of war or pushing a refrigerator, crate, or person. Create an applied force and see how it makes objects move. Change friction and see how it affects the motion of objects.

### Documentation
The [PhET Development Overview](http://bit.ly/phet-development-overview) is the most complete guide to PhET Simulation Development, how 
to obtain simulation code and its dependencies, architecture & design, how to test and build and many more important issues.

### Quick Start
(1) Clone the simulation and its dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/forces-and-motion-basics.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/assert.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/axon.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/brand.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/chipper.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/dot.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/joist.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/kite.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/phetcommon.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/scenery.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/sun.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/sherpa.git
```
(2) Start an http-server  
(3) Open [http://localhost/forces-and-motion-basics/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html](http://localhost/forces-and-motion-basics/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html) (You will probably need to update this URL based on your HTTP port and relative path.)    
(4) Visit the [PhET Development Overview](http://bit.ly/phet-development-overview) for details on minification, testing, architecture, obtaining stable (tested) code, etc.  
(5) Contact us at our mailing list: [Developing Interactive Simulations in HTML5](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/developing-interactive-simulations-in-html5)    
(6) Help us improve, create a [New Issue](https://github.com/phetsims/forces-and-motion-basics/issues/new)
