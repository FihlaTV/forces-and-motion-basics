Explore the forces at work in a tug of war or pushing a refrigerator, crate, or person. Create an applied force and see how it makes objects move. Change friction and see how it affects the motion of objects.

When checking out from git, you will need to check out a copy of phetsims/scenery to common/scenery.
This simulation is using nested git modules (without submodules) currently during its development to facilitate working on both
 forces-and-motion-basics and scenery concurrently.  When the simulation is published and enters maintenance phase,
 its dependency on scenery can be converted to a submodule or library file
