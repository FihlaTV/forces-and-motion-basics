=============
Forces and Motion: Basics  
an educational physics simulation in HTML5  
by PhET Interactive Simulations at the University of Colorado Boulder  
http://phet.colorado.edu/

Explore the forces at work in a tug of war or pushing a refrigerator, crate, or person. Create an applied force and see how it makes objects move. Change friction and see how it affects the motion of objects.

### Documentation
The [PhET Development Overview](bit.ly/phet-development-overview) is a complete guide to PhET Simulation Development, how 
to obtain simulation code and its dependencies, their architecture, how to test and build and many more important issues.

### Quick Start
(1) Check out the simulation and its dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/forces-and-motion-basics.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/assert.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/axon.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/brand.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/chipper.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/dot.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/joist.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/kite.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/phetcommon.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/scenery.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/sun.git
git clone https://github.com/phetsims/sherpa.git
```
(2) Start a http-server  
(3) Open [http://localhost/forces-and-motion-basics/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html](http://localhost/forces-and-motion-basics/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html) (You will probably need to update this URL based on your HTTP port and relative path.)  
(4) Visit [The PhET Development Overview](bit.ly/phet-development-overview) for details on minification, testing, architecture, obtaining stable (tested) code, etc.   
(5) Help us out!
